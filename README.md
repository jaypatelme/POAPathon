# POAPathon

### OG Farmers
Here we try to capture the essence of OG farmers. OG Farmers are the badass farmers that started this whole thing. They have been with us the entire time. They are like our grandparents. They have been around the world a couple of times through the good and the bad times, but no matter what, they are up in arms to always conquer what is next. 


### Intensive Farmers
Here we came up with two design ideas. In both badges, we try to remember the newcomers and those who are still in their youth, ready to work and plan out the future.  Intensive Farmers are always hard at work with planning on working in this modern world. Nothing can stop them from achieving their goals.
